/**
 * Pre-launch gate. With COMING_SOON=true the site serves only a holding page
 * and /about; everything else redirects to the holding page.
 *
 * SEO notes, since this runs on a domain we want to rank later:
 *  - redirects are 307 (temporary), never 301 — a permanent redirect would
 *    tell Google to de-index the real URLs and fold them into "/", which is
 *    expensive to undo at launch
 *  - the sitemap lists only the pages that actually resolve, so crawl budget
 *    isn't spent on URLs that just bounce
 *  - robots disallows the gated sections for the same reason
 *  - the holding page itself stays indexable, so the brand starts earning
 *    its own SERP entry before launch
 *
 * All of that reverts automatically when the flag is turned off.
